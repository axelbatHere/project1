            <p>Kanazawa Castle began construction during the Sengoku period of Japan. Being surrounded by two rivers
                on each side and situated on a high hill made this castle a natural fortress. Despite it's resilience, however,
                the castle was torched down in 1631 and had to be restored subsequently. Now in the 21st century, you can experience
                the castle that has stood the test of time. Explore the quaint castle corridors, exteriors and accomodations inside Kanazawa! 
            </p>
            <p id="firstP">Inside the Kanazawa castle province lies a garden like no other, called kenroku-en. Enchanting in it's beauty
                and rich with life, this garden is a sight to behold. It's not something you can get tired of looking at, that's for sure.
                Come during a different season, and see how the flora changes to give you that same bedazzling experience
            you had the first time.   </p>
