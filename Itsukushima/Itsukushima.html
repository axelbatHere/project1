            <p>There are a multitude of beautiful shrines which elevate just slightly above the shoreline. Wait until
            night-time to be able to see the beauty in it's full capacity. If you're wanting to do something while night-time
            creeps in, fret not! The shrines are plenty elegant as is during the daytime, and there are temples, wildlife
            (such as deer) that you can explore where they make themselves present during the day.
            </p>
            <p id="firstP">Of course, who can talk about Itsukushima without the famous Torii Gate. Depending
                on the time of day and season, the Torii Gate's massive structure will be encompassed more and more
                by the water it stands over. While not in front of a Shinto shrine as typical of other Torii gates, it still
                much represents the transition from the mundate to the sacred as one would expect. </p>
